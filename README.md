# anear
Android Emergency-Activated Recorder. These password-protected Android applications connects to a variety of smartwatches and collects psycho-physical data from the wearer.

# ED-EAR
The ED-EAR application is currently being used by Bradley Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital to collect data for their ongoing studies. The application collects data from
all available sensors that the Microsoft 2 smartwatch offers, and saves them to individual CSV files. These files are stored in a directory locally on the phone
that corresponds with the patient's ID number. Additionally, the phone that hosts this application records the surrounding audio periodically, and whenever a certain
heart-rate threshold as been reached. 

# AnearAW
This version of AnEAR is closely related to ED-EAR, but is not in clinical use. Rather than collecting data from a Microsoft Band, AnearAW collects data from any
Android Wear (now Google Wear) smartwatch. The layout of the application is nearly identical to ED-EAR, so it is also password protected and offers the same types of
settings.
