# ED-EAR
The ED-EAR application is currently being used by Bradley Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital to collect data for their ongoing studies. The application collects data from
all available sensors that the Microsoft 2 smartwatch offers, and saves them to individual CSV files. These files are stored in a directory locally on the phone
that corresponds with the patient's ID number. Additionally, the phone that hosts this application records the surrounding audio periodically, and whenever a certain
heart-rate threshold as been reached. 
Now being updated for use with Fitbit smart watches rather than Microsoft smart watches, due to discontinuation of Microsoft Band services.
